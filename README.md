# SSHFSauto
This is a shell script I made to quickly and automatically mount a remote directory (like a NAS for example) wherever you want without typing your password or anything.
It works with sshfs

- I added an install script that will also insttall a config file in /etc/init/ to allow automatic start once system and wifi are ready.

It is not perfect, any ideas to improve are welcome
